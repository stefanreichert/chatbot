- Use Java 21+ features where appropriate.
- Follow standard Java naming conventions (camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes).
- Use SLF4J for logging.
- Prefer immutability and thread safety in core classes.
- All new code should include Javadoc comments for public methods and classes.
- Use Maven for dependency management and build tasks.
- When working with embeddings or Qdrant, ensure all operations are robust to network or data errors.
- For Markdown parsing, use the Flexmark library.
- Write unit tests for all new features. 
- Organize code by feature
  - Initializer for Qdrant collections are loacted in the package `net.wickedshell.ai.chatbot.ast.qdrant`
  - Parsers for languages or formats are located in the package `net.wickedshell.ai.chatbot.ast.parser`
  - handling of embeddings is located  in the package `net.wickedshell.ai.chatbot.ast.embedding`
  - profiles for different LLMs are encapsulated in the enumeration `net.wickedshell.ai.chatbot.core.LLMProfile
- This codebase is intended to provide an setup for local execution
- The docker-compose file is located in the root directory and is used to start the Qdrant service and the Ollama LLM service
- chatbot application and qdrant initializer must use the identical LLMProfile
